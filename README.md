# timelapse-maker
This is a beautiful wrapper written entirely in BASH, extending bash-tui, and allows you to grab remote/local snapshots and combine them in a timelapse with music and text.

All this then can be uploaded on different platforms: as of now Youtube and Facebook. Youtube uploading comes from a repository here on github, whereas the Facebook upload is builtin by me.


#### Some examples of functionality:
`timelapse-maker --date today --wrap sunset --facebook --fbvideo --music=3m --publish_at='9pm today'`

Will create a time lapse from the pictures of TODAY, the length will be left up to the software (24fps is the configured default, as youtube uses 24), wrapping specifically only the sunset time. Will add music from the sub-directory '3m', Will post on Facebook the full video. And all this will be published at 9pm today.


`timelapse-maker --datePatt="201901{19..22}" --length=90 --videoSize=820x458` (quotes are important for --datePatt)

Will create a 90 second time lapse from the pictures of the days between Jan 19th and Jan 22nd, and the video will be resized to 820x458.


##### That's not just 'it'
The functionalities of this software go beyond these couple of tests, I will be documenting more and more

### You need to have installed on your system:
- ffmpeg : (https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
- ImageMagick : (https://www.imagemagick.org/)

### Requires these git repositories installed:
- Astronomicon: https://github.com/CaViCcHi/AstroNomicon.sh or the machine won't know when is sunset/sunrise and other times of day
- Bash-Tui: https://github.com/CaViCcHi/bash-tui using the basic libraries like say with its colors or bashparms
- Youtube-Upload: https://github.com/tokland/youtube-upload for uploading the youtube videos.

I might shed some requirements later in time if anyone is interested in this project alone, so I might just combine what's needed.
